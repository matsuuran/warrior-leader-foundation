<h1>THE WARRIOR LEADER</h1>
<p>The warrior leader in today's society is trained to protect and willing to serve.
they train themselves in all aspects of life; mind, body and soul.
they conduct themselves with confidence and poise, but always with humility.
their achievements and recognition for success go to their team;
their failures and shortcomings are their own.
they set the standard for others to follow and always maintain a positive attitude;
no matter what situation they find themselves in.
they push others to reach their full potential and to be the best at what they do.
they speak with frankness, but always with empathy and sincerity;
their action follows their word.
READINESS, WILLINGNESS AND DEDICATION ARE THE measures of WARRIORS.
integrity, moral character and respect are the measures of leaders.

- Brandon T. Amerine, Founder</p>
