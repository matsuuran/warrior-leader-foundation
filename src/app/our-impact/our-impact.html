        <p>Ambassador Brandon Ounlokham from Iowa City, Iowa put together the 2016 TWLF Warrior Challenge Team to compete in the University of Iowa Veterans Association Warrior Challenge at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City.

Our organization would like to thank the University of Iowa Veterans Association for allowing us to compete in such a great event and for giving us the opportunity to raise money for an amazing cause!</p>

        <p>The Iowa State Army ROTC Program hosted an event for The Warrior Leader Foundation on March 5th, 2016. The event brought together the Ames, IA and surrounding communities to honor and support military and first responders. CDT Ben Brixius headed up the event from the ROTC Program and was able to gain support and food donations from HyVee for the participants after their run was complete. We also had help and support from two of our sponsors, AI Supplements, LLC and VFNP (Virtual Fitness and Nutrition Program). The event had around 50 runners and included members of our military and law enforcement agencies. The goal of this event was to bring military and first responders together through their common Warrior Spirit. Although the military and law enforcement have separate mission sets, they each have a common Warrior Spirit and Mindset that allow them to push themselves to do their job and protect those around them. This event was a perfect display of our organizations effort to UNITE military and first responders through their common Warrior Spirit. Thank you to the Iowa State University Army ROTC program for hosting this event!</p>

        <p>The Founder of The Warrior Leader Foundation, Brandon Amerine, came up with the idea to dedicate himself to doing one burpee in his full body armor and kit for every dollar donated to starting the charity. Over the course of a month, he was able to raise $810.00 to which he completed 810 burpees in 3 hours and 14 minutes on November 11th, 2015. He did this all while wearing his full body armor plate carrier with plates, weighing just around 30 pounds. With the funds raised, our nonprofit organization was able to fundraise the initial groundbreaking paperwork and applications with the IRS to be fully recognized as a nonprofit corporation under the IRS.</p>
