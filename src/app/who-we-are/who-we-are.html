    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>The Warrior Leader Foundation, Inc. was founded by a United States Army Infantry Officer serving in the prestigious 82nd Airborne Division in 2015. With the help and assistance from an Associate of the American Red Cross, they developed an idea for a Nonprofit organization dedicated towards uniting America's military and first responders communities through their common <span class="red-bold">WARRIOR SPIRIT</span>.</p>
    <p>Although military and first responders have different roles within American society, they share a common characteristic in that both willingly raised their right hands in service to something bigger than themselves.</p>
    <p>The safety and strength of our country does not come from just one of these organizations working alone. It is a result of <span class="red-bold">BOTH</span>, military and first responders, working together towards a common goal, that is: Keeping America and it's citizens safe and free from harm's way.</p>

    <h1>Our Culture</h1>
    <p>The Warrior Leader Foundation, Inc. is striving to build a culture and environment of dedication to duty and dedication to service. We want to create a <span class="red-bold">FUN</span>, <span class="red-bold">INVITING</span>, and <span class="red-bold">SUPPORTIVE</span> environment that welcomes all military and first responders who are either serving or are veterans of their respective organizations to build lasting relationships through common interests.</p>
    <p>The military and first responder communities are made up of Warriors by nature. They each share a common bond through dedication to organizations that require teamwork, camaraderie and dedication to a common goal. Through these common characteristics, we will foster a culture that is comprised of WARRIORS in their professions and LEADERS in their communities.</p>
