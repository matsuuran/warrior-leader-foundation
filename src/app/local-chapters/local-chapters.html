    <h1 class="red content-center">Chapter Programs</h1>
    <p>Our chapter Program is the most essential part of our foundation. They provide local communities the opportunity to build meaningful relationships and support systems for and with their local military and first responders through physical, community and social activities. Each chapter has 6 functional leaders that run and coordinate events for the TWLF chapter and ensure organizational involvement within their communities. Each chapter is required to have following leaders to start:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="red-bold">Chapter Leader</span> - Responsible for the TWLF Chapter and its success. Tracks events, membership, and support from local community.</li>
        <li><span class="red-bold">Warrior Leader</span> - Ensures outreach and involvement from local military and first responders and their families.</li>
        <li><span class="red-bold">Athletic Leader</span> - Plans and coordinates events like: Crossfit workouts, sports, obbstacle races, and anything physical.</li>
        <li><span class="red-bold">Outdoors Leader</span> - Responsible for organizing events like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, paintball, and motorcycle rides as a chapter.</li>
