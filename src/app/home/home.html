        <h1>THE WARRIOR LEADER</h1>
        <p class="motto">The warrior leader in today's society is trained to protect and willing to serve
            <br> They train themselves in all aspects of life: mind, body and soul
            <br> They conduct themselves with confidence and poise, but always with humility
            <br> Their achievements and recognition for success go to their team
            <br> Their failures and shortcomings are their own
            <br> They set the standard for others to follow and always maintain a positive attitude
            <br> No matter what situation they find themselves in
            <br> They push others to reach their full potential and to be the best at what they do
            <br> They speak with frankness, but always with empathy and sincerity
            <br> Their action follows their word.
            <br>
            <span class="red-bold">readiness</span>,
            <span class="red-bold">willingness</span> and
            <span class="red-bold">dedication</span> are the measures of
            <span class="red-bold">warriors</span>.
            <br>
            <span class="red-bold">integrity</span>,
            <span class="red-bold">moral character</span> and
            <span class="red-bold">respect</span> are the measures of
            <span class="red-bold">leaders</span>.
