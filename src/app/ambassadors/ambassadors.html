    <h1 class="red content-center">Ambassador Culture</h1>
    <p>The Warrior Leader Foundation Ambassadors are a direct reflection of the type of culture and environment we are striving to build within and around our foundation. Our ambassadors work to spread the good word of our cause through their actions within their communities and beyond. TWLF Ambassadors are either current or veteran military and first responders who are live and embody the warrior spirit through their physical activities and community involvement. TWLF Ambassadors work to raise funds and awareness of our cause by representing our foundation as they participate in events such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Running Races</li>
        <li>Crossfit Competitions</li>
        <li>Lifting Competitions</li>
        <li>Shooting Competitions</li>
        <li>MMA/Boxing</li>
        <li>Marathons/Triathlons</li>
        <li>GoRuck Challenges</li>
        <li>Iron Mans</li>
        <li>Obstacle Races (Spartan Race, Warrior Dash, Tough Mudder, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The above are just a few examples of how a TWLF Ambassador can represent the warrior spirit that our organization strives to embody. Through our physical struggles and service to our communities, we can unite and honor the sacrifices that the men and women of our military and first responder communities have made in the line of duty.</p>
