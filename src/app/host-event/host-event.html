    <h1>Community Volunteer Event</h1>
    <p>Bring your community together to simply represent our TWLF, Inc. Team by being a Warrior Leader to serve those less fortunate. Host a canned food drive, clothing drive or toy drive around the holidays. You can even represent us by volunteering at a homeless shelter, elderly home or any other community based-volunteer event! Volunteer opportunities are a perfect way to spread the Warrior Spirit to those around you while representing a great cause.</p>
